# JPMC Task 3

Starter repo for task 3 of JPMC's Forage program
#Explanation on how i arrived at the final chart i have produced along with the explanation of the insight trader can draw from the new chart display
#Answer
==>With the formal visual data display of the chart to the traders, the traders are unable to monitor the ratio f two stocks so as to take advantage of the trade difference, I implemented this task by extracting the bid and ask price of each stock and dividing by 2((stock.top_ask.price + stock.top_bid.price) / 2), to get the ratio of the two stock I divided this price by each other(priceABC / priceDEF)
